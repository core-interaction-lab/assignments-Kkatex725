   <p3>By creating a series of narrative which is about the progress of a single-way field trip of Sophia, this project will traverse to 4 different online public platforms and social media sites. The platform I focus on is Uber. The notion of the entire project is to create a single-way interactive trip for users based on the new interaction I designed for the platform.

    Sophia is happy to attend a field trip to Morgan Library as she's never been there before. 

</br></br></br>Before the trip  she accessedGoogle doc to recheck her plan for the field trip.
</br></br></br>Then Sophia browsed info of destination on twitter. Then she saw a tweet of a youtube link of using uber. 
</br></br></br>In the video, the user could browse the current traffic status on Uber, which could save more time during the trip. On that day, Sophia calls Uber before she leaves the apartment .. Then she selected the car in a few seconds after briefly comparing and contrasting the arrival time and estimated fees shown below the route page. She posted a comment of Instagram link under the video to share her feedback.
</br></br></br>After the trip, Sophia views photos of the destination on Instagram and posts her own tag.
