         </section>

<section class="exhibitionone_info">
    <article>In March 2021, the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto acquired a group of 42 works by the painter Kishida Ryusei. This brings the total number of Kishida’s works in the museum collection to approximately 50 items, providing a complete overview of the artist’s creative activities and exemplifying every stylistic change that occurred from the beginning to the end of his career.
</br>In this exhibit, designed to commemorate these new acquisitions, we present all of the works by Kishida Ryusei in the museum collection. We also focus on some such as Self-Portrait Wearing a Coat, which was formerly part of the Morimura Yoshiyuki Collection, and Still Life (A Bottle, an Apple and a Teacup), which was part of Morimura’s younger brother Matsukata Saburo’s collection, while taking a look back at the role of such collections in honoring the work of Kishida.</section>
